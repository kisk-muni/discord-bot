## Scrappy

Scrappy is the Discord bot that posts updates from [scrapbook.kisk.cz](https://scrapbook.kisk.cz/) to our Discord community.

Scrappy is powered by [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/),
[Supabase Postgres database](https://supabase.com/) and runs on [Digitalocean’s App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform).

## Geting started

At this point we develop Scrappy on production database and make sure that all testing is done in private channel,
so community members don’t notice.

To get into development, please reach out to @eventually-consistent on our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/PGugj3BsE9).
You will be provided with access to the database and Discord application.
